# Slow Growth Method Simulations

This repository contains scripts to parse and generate images from slow growth method simulations.

## Directory Structure

Your simulations should be organized in the following format:

root_directory/  
│── slow_growth_method/  
│   ├── parse.py  
│   ├── parse_CH3NH3.py  (if the molecule is CH3NH3)  
│   ├── fix.py            (if the molecule is CH3NH3)  
│   ├── generate_image.py  
│   ├── get_data.py  
│   ├── get_mols.py  
│── RUN1/  
│── RUN2/  
│── ...  
│── RUNN/

## Instructions

### 1. Run `parse.py`

Navigate to the `slow_growth_method` directory and run:

    python parse.py

This script processes the simulation data from the RUNX folders.

**Note:** If the cation is CH3NH3, use `parse_CH3NH3.py` instead of `parse.py`.

In that case:

- First, copy fix.py into every run folder (RUN1, RUN2, ..., RUNN).

- Then, navigate to the main directory (where all the RUN folders and parse.sh are located), and run: bash parse.sh

This will execute `parse_CH3NH3.py` inside each RUN folder automatically.

### 2. Generate Images

In the `slow_growth_method` directory, run:

    python generate_image.py

Make sure that `get_data.py` and `get_mols.py` are also present in the same directory, as they are required for generating images.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
